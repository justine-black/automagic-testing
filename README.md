# What's in here?

A collection of scripts using various programming languages, frameworks, and tools for test and process automation. You may also find demo video recordings of the scripts running.

## Testing / Automation

### Postman

Postman is a versatile platform that simplifies API development and testing with intuitive tools for building, documenting, and sharing APIs. It excels in automating API tests, empowering teams to validate endpoints, assess performance, and generate comprehensive reports efficiently.

Navigate to the [Postman](Postman) subdirectory that contains a sample collection of API tests for my practice react app.

### Python

When seeking the best programming language to learn, Python almost always tops the list. It is highly recommended, especially for beginners, due to its gentle learning curve and remarkable versatility.

Navigate to the [Python](Python) subdirectory to see some of my progress with Python.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used for client-side web development. It may also widely used in test automation due to its ability to work seamlessly with testing frameworks like Selenium WebDriver and Jest, allowing developers to efficiently write and execute automated tests for web applications with ease.

Navigate to the [JavaScript](JavaScript) subdirectory to join me in my automation journey with JavaScript using frameworks such as Selenium and Cypress

I've also created my practice react app, [my-app-to-test](my-app-to-test/frontend/), with JavaScript using ReactJS framework and Material-UI.

### Katalon Studio

Katalon Studio is a low-code test automation platform that enables users to create and execute automated tests with minimal coding, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

Navigate to the [Katalon Studio](/Katalon%20Studio/) subdirectory to join me in my automation journey with Katalon.

## Web Development

### React.js

React.js is a popular JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility in building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture fosters reusability and simplifies the development process, while its virtual DOM ensures optimal performance by minimizing unnecessary updates. With a vibrant community and extensive documentation, React.js empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease.

Navigate to the [my-app-to-test](my-app-to-test/frontend/) subdirectory where you will find a simple web application powered by React.js with Material-UI. I created this app to practice the fundamentals of web development as well as of test automation.

The app is deployed on Netlify: https://automagic-test-app.netlify.app/

### Express.js

Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs with its streamlined design and middleware architecture. Its popularity over other frameworks stems from its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive ecosystem of plugins and middleware, allowing developers to quickly create scalable and efficient web applications.

Navigate to the [my-app-to-test/backend](my-app-to-test/backend/) subdirectory where you will find the implementation of the backend application of my [practice react app](my-app-to-test/frontend/).

The app is deployed on Heroku: https://automagic-test-app-backend-044b65bb6129.herokuapp.com/
