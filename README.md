## Testing / Automation

### Postman

Postman is a versatile platform that simplifies API development and testing with intuitive tools for building, documenting, and sharing APIs. It excels in automating API tests, empowering teams to validate endpoints, assess performance, and generate comprehensive reports efficiently.

Navigate to the [Postman](Postman) subdirectory that contains a sample collection of API tests for my practice react app.

### Python

When seeking the best programming language to learn, Python almost always tops the list. It is highly recommended, especially for beginners, due to its gentle learning curve and remarkable versatility.

Navigate to the [Python](Python) subdirectory to see some of my progress with Python.

## Web Development

### React.js

React.js is a popular JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility in building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture fosters reusability and simplifies the development process, while its virtual DOM ensures optimal performance by minimizing unnecessary updates. With a vibrant community and extensive documentation, React.js empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease.

Navigate to the [my-app-to-test](my-app-to-test/frontend/) subdirectory where you will find a simple web application powered by React.js with Material-UI. I created this app to practice the fundamentals of web development as well as of test automation.

The app is also deployed on Netlify: https://automagic-test-app.netlify.app/
