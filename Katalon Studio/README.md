## Scripts and Demo Videos

Since Katalon is a low code automation platform, it allowed me to create my automated test scripts with its record-and-playback mechanism. However, my recordings were also translated by Katalon into scripts written in Groovy and they may be found at [here](Automagic%20Test%20App/Scripts/).
