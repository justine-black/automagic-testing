# Welcome to JavaScript!

Here lies my collection of JavaScript scripts including demo videos of my script running!

## Getting started with JavaScript

Unlike Python, you don't install JavaScript itself; instead, you install or enable its frameworks.

Here are some resources I found helpful when I was getting started with JavaScript:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Find the official tutorial and documentation here.
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) - Learn JavaScript interactively with fun exercises!
