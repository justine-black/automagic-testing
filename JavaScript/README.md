# Welcome to JavaScript!

Here lies my collection of JavaScript scripts including demo videos of my script running!

## Getting started with JavaScript

Unlike Python, you don't install JavaScript itself; instead, you install or enable its frameworks.

Here are some resources I found helpful when I was getting started with JavaScript for automation and web development:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Find the official tutorial and documentation here.
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) - Learn JavaScript interactively with fun exercises!
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_library/) - Learn Selenium from its official website.
- [React](https://react.dev/learn) - Learn ReactJS, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and web development frameworks.

## Scripts and Demo Videos

Within this Python directory, you can find the source code for the scripts I authored to demonstrate automation
