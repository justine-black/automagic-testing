# Welcome to Postman!

Here lies my collection of API requests and test scripts for my practice react app, including demo videos of my them running!

## Getting started with Postman

Follow the installation and setup guide here:

- https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/overview/

You may also use other API tools such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), a lightweight, open-source alternative, that is gaining popularity for its clean and modern interface, superior performance, and extensive plugin ecosystem, providing a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for API development and testing.

I created a collection of few requests for /login, /signup, and /forgot-password REST endpoints of my practice react app. Each request also includes tests such as status code, response time, and response body tests.

Here's a demo of running the entire collection.
